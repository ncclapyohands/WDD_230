      Hey my name is Katie! I'm the girl smiling in the middle and this is my
      family! Don't get me wrong, school is fun and all, but doesn't everyone
      like summer in Portland more??? I love Salt Lick, but I am a little young
      and can't drive myself anywhere!!
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a huge neighbourhood just outside of Portland and all of us hang
      around in the yard! Sometimes, I wish i saw an ice cream truck every once
      and awhile. I would buy ALL of their ice cream. Are their any local
      drivers that would drive through my neighbourhood every Friday?? My
      friends and family will ensure you are well comped!
    </p>
