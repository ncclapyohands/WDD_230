        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <h3>Tesla</h3>
        <img src="..\images\tesla.png" />
        <p>
          The moment you open Tesla's home page, it's as if you already know
          where everything is. It's beautiful background image of the Model 3
          allows for a simplistic alignment template. Tesla's logo sitting in
          the top left, the title of the vehicle centered just above the
          vehicle, their menu, and even the inventory link hardly moves the eye
          across the screen while also catching your attention to every corner
          without even using whitespace.

        <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
        <h3>Microsoft</h3>
        <img src="..\images\Microsoft.png" />
        <p>
          The interesting part about Microsoft's website is the website is that
          it utilizes its Windows operating system styles. They have a white
          background with a simple list making their page simple and easy to
          read. They have a semetrical, simple, easy to navigate making this
          website a perfect example of its flawless execution of white space and
          clean design.

        <h2>Repetitive</h2>
        <h3>HP</h3>
        <img src="..\images\HP.png" />
        <p>
          HP has an amazing example of repetition influencing their page. They
          have three major products that they want to present to their
          consumers. These products are what they're most know for. Not only is
          there organization by using this repetition, but by creating an entire
          section that divides the three products, it allows the person viewing
          their page to easy see the product they're looking for.
